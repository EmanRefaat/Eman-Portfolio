#[Project 2: Amazon Price Scrapper](https://github.com/EmanRefaat/BlackFriday_PythonScrapper)
THis was part of personal project where a python price scrapper was build in order to track prices for specific item on amazon.
The way the model works is you add a link to the amazon product and the price you're willing to buy the prodcut at ( target price)
and it will refresh script every 24 hours and check the price for the product, as sson as the price of the product reaches, 
send you an email alert.
